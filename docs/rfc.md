# RFC: Award Flight Search Application

## Problem Statement

Travel enthusiasts and frequent flyers need an efficient way to search and compare award flight availability across multiple airlines. The current process of checking individual airline websites is time-consuming and inefficient. We need to create a user-friendly interface that leverages the Seats.aero API to provide a streamlined search experience with advanced filtering and sorting capabilities.

## Solution

### Core Features

1. Integration with Seats.aero cached search API
2. Interactive search interface
3. Advanced filtering and sorting system
4. Responsive design for multiple devices

### User Stories

#### Search Functionality

- As a user, I want to search for award flights by entering origin and destination airports
- As a user, I want to specify my travel dates to find relevant flights
- As a user, I want to see search results immediately using cached data
- As a user, I want to see loading states while the application fetches results

#### Results Management

- As a user, I want to sort flights by award prices (miles/points required)
- As a user, I want to sort flights by departure/arrival times
- As a user, I want to filter results by specific airlines

#### User Interface

- As a user, I want to see clear visual representations of flight details
- As a user, I want to see a mobile-friendly interface
- As a user, I want to see clear error messages when something goes wrong

## Technical Considerations

### Architecture

1. Next.js Application Structure

   - Client-side rendering (CSR) approach
   - Search form is interactive and doesn't need SSR
   - No SEO requirements for search interface
   - Better performance for interactive components

2. Client-Side Architecture

   - React components with client-side state
   - Form handling with react-hook-form
   - React Query for data fetching and caching
   - Client-side filtering and sorting
   - Infinite scroll implementation with React Query

3. Performance Considerations

   - Bundle optimization for client-side code
   - Efficient state management with React Query
   - Optimized rendering for multiple selections
   - Memoization for expensive calculations
   - Virtual scrolling for large result sets

4. Type Safety and Validation
   - TypeScript for type checking
   - Zod schemas for form validation
   - Strong typing for airport data structure
   - Runtime validation for user inputs

### Airport Data Structure

Since there's no direct API for airport listings, we'll implement a curated list of Asian airports with creating a new API endpoint in NextJS App.

### Handling Result Data

#### Response Structure

The search results will leverage React Query's infinite query capabilities:

- Default to 20 results per request
- Implement infinite scroll using React Query's useInfiniteQuery
- Support cursor-based pagination via pageParam
- Include metadata for scroll state management

#### Core Response Elements

1. Flight Results Array

   - Flight details including routes, dates, and availability
   - Airline and mileage cost information
   - Direct flight indicators
   - Seat availability

2. Pagination Metadata

   - Total count of current results
   - Has more indicator for additional results
   - Cursor value for next page tracking
   - Complete URL for next page request

3. Search Parameters
   - Origin and destination airports
   - Date range
   - Current page cursor
   - Results per page (20)

#### Pagination Implementation

1. React Query Integration

   - Implement useInfiniteQuery for efficient data fetching
   - Automatic background updates and cache invalidation
   - Built-in error and loading states
   - Optimistic updates for better UX

2. Infinite Scroll Implementation

   - Use Intersection Observer for scroll detection
   - Leverage React Query's hasNextPage and fetchNextPage
   - Implement efficient scroll restoration
   - Handle loading states with skeleton UI

3. Performance Optimizations

   - Automatic request deduplication via React Query
   - Smart background cache updates
   - Configurable stale time and cache lifetime
   - Prefetching support for smoother UX

4. Data Management

   - Automatic cache management by React Query
   - Parallel request handling
   - Automatic retry on failure
   - Cache persistence options

#### Why React Query for Infinite Scroll

1. Built-in Features

   - Automatic background updates
   - Smart cache invalidation
   - Built-in infinite query support
   - Parallel request handling
   - Request deduplication
   - Automatic error retry

2. Developer Experience

   - Simplified state management
   - Reduced boilerplate code
   - Type-safe data fetching
   - Intuitive API for infinite queries
   - Built-in devtools

3. Performance Benefits

   - Efficient cache management
   - Optimized re-renders
   - Background data synchronization
   - Configurable stale time
   - Request cancellation

4. Production Readiness

   - Battle-tested in production
   - Active maintenance
   - Strong community support
   - Extensive documentation
   - TypeScript support

#### Error Handling

1. Response Validation

   - Verify data structure
   - Handle empty results
   - Manage pagination errors
   - Network failure recovery

2. Edge Cases
   - End of results detection
   - Invalid cursor values
   - Duplicate results prevention
   - Loading state management

### Accessibility (WCAG 2.2)

1. Search Form Accessibility

   - Proper form control labeling for airport inputs
   - Accessible date picker implementation
   - Clear error messaging for form validation
   - Keyboard navigation for airport selection dropdowns

2. Results Display

   - Proper heading structure for search results
   - ARIA live regions for dynamic result updates
   - Focus management during infinite scroll
   - Clear price and availability information
   - Sufficient color contrast for flight status

3. Interactive Elements

   - Keyboard support for all filtering options
   - Focus visible for all interactive elements
   - Clear loading state indicators
   - Skip links for main content areas

4. Testing Requirements
   - Screen reader compatibility
   - Keyboard navigation testing
   - Mobile accessibility validation

## Drawbacks/Risks/Possible Failures

1. Data Reliability

   - API availability and rate limits
   - Stale cache data
   - Missing flight information

2. Airport Data Limitations

   - No direct API for airport listings
   - Manual curation of Asian airports required
   - Potential for outdated airport information
   - Limited to specific regions initially

3. Search Performance

   - Large result sets may impact performance
   - Browser memory management for infinite scroll
   - Network latency impact on user experience

4. Edge Cases
   - Incomplete or invalid API responses
   - Connection timeout scenarios
