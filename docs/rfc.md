# RFC: Award Flight Search Application

## Problem Statement

Travel enthusiasts and frequent flyers need an efficient way to search and compare award flight availability across multiple airlines. The current process of checking individual airline websites is time-consuming and inefficient. We need to create a user-friendly interface that leverages the Seats.aero API to provide a streamlined search experience with advanced filtering and sorting capabilities.

## Solution

### Core Features

1. Integration with Seats.aero cached search API
2. Interactive search interface
3. Advanced filtering and sorting system
4. Responsive design for multiple devices

### User Stories

#### Search Functionality

- As a user, I want to search for award flights by entering origin and destination airports
- As a user, I want to specify my travel dates to find relevant flights
- As a user, I want to see search results immediately using cached data
- As a user, I want to see loading states while the application fetches results

#### Results Management

- As a user, I want to sort flights by award prices (miles/points required)
- As a user, I want to sort flights by departure/arrival times
- As a user, I want to filter results by specific airlines

#### User Interface

- As a user, I want to see clear visual representations of flight details
- As a user, I want to see a mobile-friendly interface
- As a user, I want to see clear error messages when something goes wrong

## Technical Considerations

### Architecture

1. Next.js frontend application

   - Server-side rendering for better SEO
   - Client-side state management

2. Type Safety

   - TypeScript implementation
   - Strong typing for API responses

3. Performance
   - Cached API responses
   - Optimized filtering/sorting operations
