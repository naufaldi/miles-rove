Objective:

Develop a Next.js frontend application that integrates with the [Seats.aero](http://developer.seats.aero/) API to search award flight availability.
Create an intuitive user interface with sorting and filtering features to refine search results, including options to sort by price and other criteria.
You are free to add additional filtering options and UI enhancements as you see fit.

[Seats.aero](http://developer.seats.aero/) short description:

[Seats.aero](http://seats.aero/) is a powerful search engine for award travel that lets users explore available award flights across major airline alliances. The platform continuously updates award availability in the background and provides instant results through its cached search API. [Seats.aero](http://Seats.aero) offers both cached and live search options **for this test, we will use only cached search (**https://developers.seats.aero/reference/cached-search)
